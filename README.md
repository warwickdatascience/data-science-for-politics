This repository contains presentation material for WDSS's 'Data Science for Politics' talk, held virtually on the 6th May 2020. The original stream can be re-watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l40-JFn6F9M). The talk description is as follows:

> The modern world is driven by data and so it only makes sense that political theory should follow this trend. In the first of Warwick Data Science Society's virtual term 3 talks we have the opportunity to listen to two Warwick students discuss how they have used data science to solve political problem.
>
> The first speaker is Ben Newey, a second year PPE student, who will discuss how he used data science to produce a model for predicting the 2019 UK general election which performed stronger than most individual pollsters.
>
>The second speaker is Tim Hargreaves, a second year Mathematics and Statistics student, who will showcase how he used social media data to create a simple yet robust model for presidential approval in the United States.
